# What is Hardened Linux From Scratch?

Hardened Linux From Scratch (HLFS) is a project that provides you with step-by-step instructions for building your own customized and hardened Linux system entirely from source. Based on LFS, this project will incorporate parts of BLFS as well. The main differences from these other projects will be the amount of text dealing with security configuration issues as well as patching or substituting many of the packages used for improved security.

# Why would I want an HLFS system?

If you are wondering why you would want an HLFS system, just read any number of articles dealing with hackers and script kiddies breaking into systems and destroying them or stealing from them. This book goes to some extremes to lock down known and unknown security threats, including patching the core toolchain to prevent buffer overflows.

If you are wondering why you would want an LFS system or don't know what LFS is then you don't want to be here just yet - you should head over to the LFS Project Homepage where all will be explained.

# What can I do with my HLFS system?

This book will initially be geared towards building production-quality servers, routers, and firewalls. Many BLFS packages will compile and run as-is and work is under way to support the most problematic desktop tools as well.
