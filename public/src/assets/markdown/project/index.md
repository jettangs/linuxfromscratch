# How many subprojects we have ?

Linux From Scratch (LFS) is a project that provides you with step by step instructions for building your own custom Linux system, entirely from source code. Currently, the Linux From Scratch organization consists of the following subprojects:

#### [LFS](#/projects/LFS)

Linux From Scratch is the main book, the base from which all other projects are derived.

#### [ALFS](#/projects/ALFS)

Automated Linux From Scratch provides tools for automating and managing LFS and BLFS builds.

#### [BLFS](#/projects/BLFS)

Beyond Linux From Scratch helps you extend your finished LFS installation into a more customized and usable system.

#### [CLFS](#/projects/CLFS)

Cross Linux From Scratch provides the means to cross####compile an LFS system on many types of systems.

#### [HLFS](#/projects/HLFS)

Hardened Linux From Scratch focuses on building an LFS system with heightened security.

#### [Hints](#/projects/Hints)

The Hints project is a collection of documents that explain how to enhance your LFS system in ways that are not included in the LFS or BLFS books.

#### [LiveCD](#/projects/LiveCD)

The LiveCD project provides a CD that is useful as an LFS build host or as a general rescue CD.

#### [Patches](#/projects/Patches)

The Patches project serves as a central repository for all patches useful to an LFS user.
