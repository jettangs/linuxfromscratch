# What is the LFS Patches Project?

The Patches project serves as a central repository for all patches useful to an LFS user. It also serves as a testing ground for patches that may later be incorporated into the LFS and BLFS book. The patches that are in the repository, but that are not included in the book, are primarily meant for users already familiar with LFS. First time LFS users should adhere to the versions and patches which are in LFS or BLFS.

Patches are submitted by individual users, and might not be tested by the LFS Testing Team. They carry no warranty of any sort. Apply the patches at your own risk.

The patches mailing list is only for submission of patches and for discussion related to the development of the Patches project. Discussion related to patches should be on the appropriate support or development list. Most likely that will be blfs-dev or lfs-dev.
