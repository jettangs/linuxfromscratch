# What are LFS Hints?

The LFS Hints are small documents that explain how to do things that are not covered in the LFS or BLFS books. They provide a variety of information such as alternative ways of building and configuring packages, information on new/unstable packages that haven't yet made it into the books, specialized techniques for specific hardware, and other areas that are of interest to LFS users.

If you have a specific problem which is not answered by LFS, BLFS, the FAQ or the project documentation, chances are there is a hint written about it, detailing everything you need to know. And if there isn't, you can [write one yourself](http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/hints/howtowrite.html) !

Have fun reading or writing !
